# Color Themes For Enclojure NetBeans Clojure Plugin

By default, enclojure has been setting it's own colors (matching the old NetBeans 5.5 scheme). If you try to use other profiles (especially with dark backgrounds) it doesn't play along very well. 

## Defaults
The defaults zip removes these overrides and inherits from the profile defaults. This is also used as the starting point for the other themes here. So it should be installed first in all cases.

Install the [defaults zip](http://github.com/downloads/thickey/enclojure-colors/enclojure-colors-defaults-20100913.zip) via NetBeans Preferences > Fonts & Colors > Import


## Sunburst
Based on the [Sunburst theme for TextMate](http://wiki.macromates.com/Themes/UserSubmittedThemes#sunburst), and modifying the [NetBeans port of that theme by Zach Wood](http://purplerockscissors.com/2009/07/textmate-sunburst-theme-netbeans/).

First, install the [NetBeans Sunburst theme](http://zacharywood.com/junk/sunburst_netbeans.zip), then install the [clojure add-on theme](http://github.com/downloads/thickey/enclojure-colors/enclojure-colors-sunburst-20100913.zip).
